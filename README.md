# SpaceX-Launch-Site-Success-Rate-Analysis-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to identify patterns in launch site performance and predict the likelihood of mission success. The analysis explores how factors such as launch site, payload mass, and booster version influence mission outcomes.

Using data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Plotly, and Folium), the project maps launch sites geographically, compares their success rates, and highlights relationships between payload mass and mission success. Additionally, machine learning models are applied to predict whether a future launch will succeed based on historical data.

The insights gained from this study can support data-driven decision-making in space mission planning, helping evaluate which launch sites provide the highest probability of success.
